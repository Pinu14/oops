#oop
#class
# class is collection of attribute and methods
# it is like plan/blueprint to create obj
# it is logical entity
# memory is not required

object
#it is physical entity
# it is an instance (obj) of class
#memory is required for execution

#refernce variable
#it is a variable which is poiting to obj.
# we can access data members (attributes)and methods of that obj var.refvar.methodname().

#constructor
#it is one special of method
#it is automatically get invoked(call) when object in to memory
# it is used to initialize the attributes of the class
# job of constructor is to initialize object into memory
# means initialize attributes into memory

#few type of constructors
# default constructor
# parameterized constructor
# copy constructor
#  constructor exicutes only once per object

#types of variable in py
#what is variable
#it is like a container which may or not store data
#it is named memory location

#types of variable in py oop 
#3 types of variable in oop 
#instance variable 
#class variable (static )
#local variable

#instance variable 
#The variable which are written with self keyword is called instance variable 
#individual copy is created for every object
#these variables are initialized byusing constructor 
#those are accessed by using self and ref var

 #2.class variable (static )
 #class variable are the variable which are created outside constructor and inside class body
 #single copy is created and shared among all objects 
 #we can change ,update class variable and update value is shared with all objects
 #class variable can be accessed by ref variable as well as class name
 

#what is method
#it is function which is written inside class.
#def key word is used 
#it is like subprogram/bunch of /group of statements which processing some data (attributes/variable
#its a functionality of that object or its a feture of that object

#types of method /functions
#instance method
#class method
#static method

#instance method
#to process instance variable we need instance method
#first argument if instance method is self 
           #def methodname(self):
              #processing of instance variable \
